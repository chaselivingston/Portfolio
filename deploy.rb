# Base methods of deployment. One will deploy to the test server, the other deploys to

require 'capistrano/ext/multistage'

# We trigger the following recipes after a deployment, which are not the default:
#
#	deploy:cleanup - Default Rails recipe. Removes older releases that take up space.
#				The keep_releases variable controls how many are left after each cleanup.
#				The only reason to keep the old versions around is if something were to go
#				wrong (in which case you might run `cap deploy:rollback`).
#
#	deploy:link_db_config - A new recipe that links the application's private database
#				configuration to an existing global configuration for the server. This way,
#				you don't have to leave a password in version control.
#
#	deploy:migrate - Default Rails recipe. Runs migrations. For some reason, this isn't
#				a natural part of a deployment, even though not migrating would obviously
#				break things.
